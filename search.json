    "text": "Experimental design forms the foundation of scientific inquiry whenever the goal is to understand how certain controllable inputs (factors) influence outcomes (responses). By carefully planning how to collect data and assigning treatments to experimental units, we can draw valid causal inferences about these relationships. Unlike observational studies, experiments involve actively manipulating factors to reveal their effects while controlling for unwanted variability.\nThis set of lecture notes provides a comprehensive overview of experimental design concepts and applications. We will address how to define clear objectives, classify sources of variation, choose appropriate experimental designs, apply randomization, incorporate blocking, specify statistical models, and determine appropriate sample sizes. Real-world examples and R code snippets will illustrate key ideas. Additionally, we will integrate exercises, class activities, summaries, challenges, and visual aids to reinforce understanding."

    "section": "Variation Sources",
    "text": "Variation Sources\nVariation in responses can arise from multiple sources:\n\nMajor Variation (Treatment Effects): Due to the factors of interest (e.g., different fertilizers or drug dosages).\nNuisance Factors: Variables that influence the response but are not of primary interest (e.g., room temperature, operator skill). Some nuisance factors can be controlled or incorporated as blocking factors, while others must be accepted as noise.\n\nBy identifying and classifying sources of variation, we can decide which factors to manipulate as treatments, which to fix or control, and which to block or treat as covariates.\n\nExample\nConsider an agricultural experiment testing different fertilizer types (A, B, C). The main factors are the fertilizer types. Soil heterogeneity could be a nuisance factor. If the field has varying soil quality, it might mask the fertilizer effect. Recognizing this early allows us to incorporate blocking or other strategies to handle this nuisance variation.\n\n\nActivity: Think-Pair-Share\n\nThink: Imagine you are testing two workout plans (high-intensity vs. moderate-intensity) to improve muscle strength.\nPair: Discuss with a partner what the main objective is and what factors could cause unwanted variation (e.g., baseline fitness level, diet).\nShare: Volunteer pairs share their classification of factors and whether they could be controlled or blocked.\n\n\n\nChallenges and Common Mistakes\n\nStarting without a clear objective can lead to inconclusive results.\nConfusing major variation with nuisance variation can misdirect the design.\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nConceptual: Why must objectives be clear before starting an experiment?\nNumerical: Given three fertilizer types and two soil conditions, identify which factors should be considered treatments and which might be nuisance factors.\nProof/Derivation: Show mathematically that failing to control a nuisance factor increases the variance of treatment effect estimates.\n\nKey Takeaways: - Well-defined objectives shape the experiment. - Classifying factors into treatment and nuisance categories enhances design efficiency."

    "text": "Example: Random Assignment and ANOVA\nSuppose we have three treatments (A, B, C) and want to randomly assign them to 9 experimental units.\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\n\nset.seed(123)\n# Treatments\n\ntreatments &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")\n# We have 9 units, randomly assign treatments\n\nassignments &lt;- sample(rep(treatments, each=3))\nassignments\n\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"A\" \"C\" \"B\" \"C\" \"A\" \"B\"\n\n\nThis code generates a random permutation of A, B, and C assigned to the units.\nNow assume we collected data (simulated responses):\n\n# Simulate responses with a true difference: A &lt;-  B &lt;-  C\ntrue_means &lt;- c(A=10, B=12, C=15)\nresponses &lt;- rnorm(9, mean=rep(true_means, each=3), sd=2)\ndata &lt;- data.frame(unit = 1:9,treatment = assignments, response = responses)\n\n# Fit an ANOVA model\nfit &lt;- aov(response ~ treatment, data=data)\nsummary(fit)\n\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)\ntreatment    2  32.01   16.00   1.287  0.343\nResiduals    6  74.61   12.44               \n\n\nThe ANOVA table will show how between-treatment variability compares to within-treatment variability. With a large enough difference and adequate replication, we expect a significant treatment effect.\nConclusion\nExperimental design is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. By employing replication, blocking, and randomization, statisticians and researchers can draw clearer causal conclusions, improve the efficiency of experimentation, and ensure the validity of statistical tests.\nKey Takeaways:\n\nRandomization prevents systematic bias and validates inferential methods.\nReplication provides robust estimates of variability and supports generalizability.\nBlocking controls known sources of variation, improving precision.\nFactorial designs offer a more comprehensive view of multiple factors simultaneously.\n\nFuture sessions may delve deeper into specific complex designs (e.g., Latin squares, split-plots) and advanced analysis methods, ensuring students appreciate the rich interplay between design and analysis."

Let \\(Y_{ij}\\) represent the response from the \\(j\\)-th replicate of treatment \\(i\\). Assuming \\(Y_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) with \\(\\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\):\n\nRandomization ensures that \\((\\varepsilon_{ij})\\) are exchangeable random variables.\nUnder \\(H_0: \\alpha_i=0\\), the test statistic (e.g., ANOVA F-statistic) follows an F-distribution derived from the ratio of quadratic forms in normal variables (Scheffé, 1959).\nWithout randomization, the assumptions that justify the standard F and t distributions could be invalid, making inferences incorrect.\n\nFor more technical details, see Kempthorne (1977, Ch. 2)."

    "text": "In mathematical statistics, well-structured experimental designs and robust analytical methods are essential for drawing valid conclusions about treatment effects. One of the simplest yet fundamental designs is the completely randomized design (CRD). Under a CRD, each experimental unit is randomly assigned to one of several treatment conditions without any blocking factors. This approach ensures that all treatments have an equal chance of being applied to each unit, thereby mitigating systematic biases and facilitating straightforward inference.\nA key tool for analyzing CRDs is the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The one-way ANOVA tests whether at least two of several treatment means differ significantly. Building upon principles of linear models, least squares estimation, and classical hypothesis testing, the one-way ANOVA provides a comprehensive framework to quantify uncertainty and make decisions about treatments based on observed data.\n\n\n\nUnderstand the structure and rationale behind the completely randomized design.\nLearn the randomization procedure and the role of coding treatments.\nFormulate the one-way ANOVA model and understand its assumptions.\nExplore concepts of estimability, least squares estimation, and the distribution of estimators.\nApply the ANOVA test to decide whether treatments differ significantly.\nCalculate sample size and power, and incorporate these insights when planning experiments.\nDemonstrate procedures using R, including randomization, data input, fitting models, and producing ANOVA tables."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nA completely randomized design and its corresponding one-way ANOVA analysis form the bedrock of experimental inference when blocking is unnecessary. By carefully randomizing treatments, modeling responses, and applying least squares estimation, one can confidently infer whether treatments differ.\nWe introduced the conceptual framework and key formulae, showed how to conduct hypothesis tests and interpret ANOVA results, discussed sample size and power considerations, and provided R code for practical execution. Mastery of these fundamentals empowers researchers to design efficient experiments, maximize the utility of collected data, and confidently draw conclusions about treatment effects."
