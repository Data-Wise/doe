Causal interpretations are limited.\nControlled experiments, on the other hand, manipulate factor levels and apply treatments to subjects (experimental units). By controlling the allocation of treatments, experiments more reliably identify causes of variation and support causal conclusions."

True replication involves distinct subjects or units.\n\nWithout adequate replication, it is difficult to separate true treatment effects from random noise."

    "section": "Blocking",
    "text": "Blocking\n\nConcept: Blocking is used to control extraneous variation by grouping experimental units into homogeneous subsets called blocks. Treatments are then compared within these blocks.\nExample: If environmental conditions vary across different times of day, you may form blocks of time periods and randomly assign treatments within each block. This reduces noise and increases the precision of comparisons among treatments.\nOutcome: Blocking improves the precision of inference by removing a known source of variability, making it easier to detect treatment differences."

    "text": "Randomization\n\nRationale: Random assignment of treatments to experimental units is fundamental. It ensures that no systematic bias influences treatment allocation.\nBenefits:\n\n  - Prevents experimenter preferences or unconscious patterns from influencing results.\n  - Justifies the use of standard statistical distributions (F, t) for inference.\n  - Confirms that observed effects can be attributed to treatments and not assignment bias.\nReference: Kempthorne (1977) explains how randomization ensures the validity of distributional assumptions underpinning common statistical tests.\n\nMethods of Randomization\n\nRandom Number Generators (RNG): Computer programs or calculators produce pseudo-random digits, used to assign treatments.\nRandom Number Tables: Historically used, a random table combined with random starting points can ensure unbiased allocations.\nEnsuring True Randomness: Use objective random devices (dice, RNGs) and avoid human-chosen “random” sequences, as humans are prone to inadvertent patterns."

    "text": "Example: Random Assignment and ANOVA\nSuppose we have three treatments (A, B, C) and want to randomly assign them to 9 experimental units.\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed for reproducibility\n\nset.seed(123)\n# Treatments\n\ntreatments &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")\n# We have 9 units, randomly assign treatments\n\nassignments &lt;- sample(rep(treatments, each=3))\nassignments\n\n\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"A\" \"C\" \"B\" \"C\" \"A\" \"B\"\n\n\nThis code generates a random permutation of A, B, and C assigned to the units.\nNow assume we collected data (simulated responses):\n\n\nCode\n# Simulate responses with a true difference: A &lt;-  B &lt;-  C\ntrue_means &lt;- c(A=10, B=12, C=15)\nresponses &lt;- rnorm(9, mean=rep(true_means, each=3), sd=2)\ndata &lt;- data.frame(unit = 1:9,treatment = assignments, response = responses)\n\n# Fit an ANOVA model\nfit &lt;- aov(response ~ treatment, data=data)\nsummary(fit)\n\n\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)\ntreatment    2  32.01   16.00   1.287  0.343\nResiduals    6  74.61   12.44               \n\n\nThe ANOVA table will show how between-treatment variability compares to within-treatment variability. With a large enough difference and adequate replication, we expect a significant treatment effect.\nConclusion\nExperimental design is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. By employing replication, blocking, and randomization, statisticians and researchers can draw clearer causal conclusions, improve the efficiency of experimentation, and ensure the validity of statistical tests.\nKey Takeaways:\n\nRandomization prevents systematic bias and validates inferential methods.\nReplication provides robust estimates of variability and supports generalizability.\nBlocking controls known sources of variation, improving precision.\nFactorial designs offer a more comprehensive view of multiple factors simultaneously.\n\nFuture sessions may delve deeper into specific complex designs (e.g., Latin squares, split-plots) and advanced analysis methods, ensuring students appreciate the rich interplay between design and analysis."

Assuming \\(Y_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) with \\(\\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\):\n\nRandomization ensures that \\((\\varepsilon_{ij})\\) are exchangeable random variables.\nUnder \\(H_0: \\alpha_i=0\\), the test statistic (e.g., ANOVA F-statistic) follows an F-distribution derived from the ratio of quadratic forms in normal variables (Scheffé, 1959).\nWithout randomization, the assumptions that justify the standard F and t distributions could be invalid, making inferences incorrect.\n\nFor more technical details, see Kempthorne (1977, Ch. 2)."
